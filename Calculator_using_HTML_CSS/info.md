Summary:
In this folder, I have uploaded two works (Calculator & Draw Circle/Rectangle based on instruction) that I developed using HTML and CSS during my class of Advanced Data Visulaization.  


Instructions:

Task 1
Create a simple calculator. The numbers (0-9) with basic operations (+, *, /, -) and inputbox to display result. The numbers should be white background with black font. The operators should be black background with white font. The operators should have a font size larger than the numbers. The numbers and operators should be organized in a grid

Task 2
Create a web page with a box to input a number and three buttons called "Circle", "Square", and "Clear." If you enter a number say '4' into the box and press "Circle" then create a circle with radius 4. If you press "Square"  then display a square where each side is 4. If you If you press "Clear" then the circle/square should be erased from the page.
